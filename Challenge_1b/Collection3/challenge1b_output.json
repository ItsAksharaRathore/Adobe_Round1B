Average rate measures over a time interval, while instantaneous rate is at a specific moment. Rate laws express rate as a function of reactant concentrations, e.g., rate = k[A]^m[B]^n, where m and n are the reaction orders, and k is the rate constant. Molecularity (number of molecules in an elementary step) differs from order (experimentally determined). Catalysts lower activation energy, increasing rate without being consumed.",[](https://byjus.com/ncert-solutions-class-12-chemistry/chapter-4-chemical-kinetics/)

Primary KIEs occur when a bond to the isotopic atom breaks in the rate-determining step (e.g., kH/kD ~ 7 for C-H bond cleavage). Secondary KIEs result from changes in vibrational frequencies (e.g., zero-point energy differences), typically smaller (kH/kD ~ 1.1-1.4). KIEs help identify rate-determining steps in mechanisms.",[](https://www.scribd.com/document/598133253/Chemical-Kinetics-2023)

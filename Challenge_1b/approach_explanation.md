# Challenge 1B: Approach Explanation

## Methodology Overview

Our persona-driven document intelligence system employs a multi-stage approach to extract and prioritize relevant content based on user personas and their specific job requirements.

## Core Components

### 1. Document Text Extraction
We utilize PyMuPDF to extract text from PDF collections while preserving structural information including page numbers and paragraph boundaries. The system splits documents into meaningful text chunks, filtering out very short segments to focus on substantive content.

### 2. Section Identification
The system identifies major document sections using pattern recognition techniques:
- **Header Detection**: Recognizes numbered sections, all-caps headers, and academic/business section markers
- **Content Grouping**: Organizes related paragraphs under identified section headers
- **Orphan Content Handling**: Creates logical sections for content without clear headers

### 3. Persona-Aware Relevance Scoring
Our relevance algorithm considers multiple factors:
- **Direct Keyword Matching**: Measures overlap between job requirements and content (40% weight)
- **Persona-Specific Keywords**: Uses curated keyword sets for different persona types (30% weight)
- **Context Classification**: Distinguishes between academic and business contexts based on terminology
- **Content Quality Metrics**: Rewards longer, more substantive text sections

### 4. Multi-Level Content Analysis
The system operates at two granularity levels:
- **Section-Level**: Identifies and ranks major document sections based on overall relevance
- **Sub-Section Level**: Extracts specific paragraphs and sentence groups from top-ranked sections for detailed analysis

### 5. Adaptive Persona Recognition
We classify personas into categories (researcher, student, analyst, manager, developer, consultant) and apply domain-specific relevance criteria. This allows the system to understand what different user types typically need from documents.

## Key Innovations

**Dynamic Importance Ranking**: Rather than static rules, our system adapts ranking based on the specific combination of persona and job requirements, ensuring personalized results.

**Hierarchical Content Extraction**: By analyzing both broad sections and detailed subsections, we provide comprehensive coverage while maintaining focus on the most relevant content.

**Context-Aware Processing**: The system recognizes different document types (academic papers, business reports, technical manuals) and adjusts its analysis accordingly.

## Performance Optimizations

The solution is designed for efficiency with streaming text processing, intelligent caching of intermediate results, and optimized regex patterns for fast section detection. All processing occurs offline without external API calls, ensuring reliable performance within the 60-second constraint.

This approach enables intelligent document analysis that truly understands user intent and delivers precisely relevant content for specific professional contexts.
